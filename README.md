Flashlight Video
================

Minimal flashlight app for android that launches turns on the Android's flash and displays a video preview of what the camera sees.
Great for looking for lost items in dark places.

This app requires camera permissions, and is open sourced at https://github.com/levis501/FlashlightVideo
